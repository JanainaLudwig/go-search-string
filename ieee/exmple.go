One promising approach to testing the functionality of Web applications leverages the user-session data collected by Web servers. User-session-based testing automatically generates test cases based on real user profiles. The key contribution of this paper is the application of concept analysis for clustering user sessions and a set of heuristics for test case selection. Existing incremental concept analysis algorithms are exploited to avoid collecting and maintaining large user-session data sets and to thus provide scalability. We have completely automated the process from user session collection and test suite reduction through test case replay. Our incremental test suite update algorithm, coupled with our experimental study, indicates that concept analysis provides a promising means for incrementally updating reduced test suites in response to newly captured user sessions with little loss in fault detection capability and program coverage.","article_number":"4302777","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4302777","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4302777/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4302777/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","publication_number":32,"is_number":4302773,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Oct. 2007","start_page":"643","end_page":"658","citing_paper_count":68,"citing_patent_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Application software","Automatic testing","Web server","Computer Society","Government","Algorithm design and analysis","Software testing","Clustering algorithms","Scalability","Fault detection"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Software testing","Web applications","User-session-based testing","Test suite reduction","Concept analysis","Incremental test suite reduction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/ICST.2013.82","title":"Research Questions for Model-Based Vulnerability Testing of Web Applications","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-5961-0","issn":"2159-4848","rank":3,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"DISC Dept., FEMTO-ST Inst., Besancon, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37072490900","id":37072490900,"full_name":"Alexandre Vernotte","author_order":1}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"This paper presents my Ph.D. research that focuses on developing concepts and techniques for Model-Based Vulnerability Testing (MBVT) of Web Applications.

Web testing is one of the methods to ensure the Web security. However, due to the special characters of Web applications, traditional testing methods are not suitable for Web testing in many as-pects. A typical Web application consists of two tiers: the client, the server. Most existing works consider Web applications testing from an external or a user's view, not taken the interactions and the behaviors of the server side into account. In this paper, special care on the interactions and the behaviors of server side is paid, and an approach to model composition and testing Web applications is proposed. FSMs are used to model Web applications from the user's side, and the server's side, respectively. Then, synchronous product was employed as a tool to construct a composition of FSMs. Finally, based on the composition of FSM, test generation is given out which satisfies the correspond-ing coverage criteria.","article_number":"6128187","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6128187","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6128187/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6128187/","publication_title":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","conference_location":"Sanya, China","conference_dates":"3-4 Dec. 2011","publication_number":6126162,"is_number":6128049,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"3-4 Dec. 2011","start_page":"568","end_page":"572","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":2,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Servers","Testing","Unified modeling language","Web pages","Automata","Computational modeling","Security"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["test coverage criteria","web application","test generation","model composition"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4584-4","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2008-6","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2011.98","title":"An Abstract Transaction Model for Testing the Web Services Transactions","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-0-7695-4463-2","partnum":"11PR4463","rank":5,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Dept. of Comput., Univ. of Oviedo, Gijon, Spain","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37544587300","id":37544587300,"full_name":"Ruben Casado","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Dept. of Comput., Univ. of Oviedo, Gijon, Spain","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282709300","id":37282709300,"full_name":"Javier Tuya","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Sch. of Technol., Oxford Brookes Univ., Oxford, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38502362800","id":38502362800,"full_name":"Muhammad Younas","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Transactions are a fundamental technology for building efficient and reliable web service based applications.

Such applications have to face a variety of sophisticated and subtle attacks. The difficulty of identifying respective vulnerabilities steadily increases with the complexity of applications. Moreover, the art of penetration testing predominantly depends on the skills of highly trained test experts. The difficulty to test web applications hence represents a daunting challenge to their developers. As a step towards improving security analyses, model checking has, at the model level, been found capable of identifying complex attacks and thus moving security analyses towards a push-button technology. In order to bridge the gap with actual systems, we present Spa Cite. This tool relies on a dedicated model-checker for security analyses that generates potential attacks with regard to common vulnerabilities in web applications. Then, it semi-automatically runs those attacks on the System Under Validation (SUV) and reports which vulnerabilities were successfully exploited. We applied Spa Cite to Role-Based-Access-Control (RBAC) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) lessons of Web Goat, an insecure web application maintained by OWASP. The tool successfully reproduced RBAC and XSS attacks.","article_number":"6200199","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6200199","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6200199/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6200199/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation","conference_location":"Montreal, QC, Canada","conference_dates":"17-21 April 2012","publication_number":6200016,"is_number":6200080,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"17-21 April 2012","start_page":"858","end_page":"859","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Testing","Browsers","Protocols","Analytical models","Engines","Access control"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["security testing","web application","bridging abstraction gaps","model-checking","fault-injection","mutation testing","WebGoat"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1906-6","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4670-4","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/ICSTW.2013.57","title":"Automatic Generation of Test Drivers for Model Inference of Web Applications","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-1324-4","rank":7,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Univ. de Grenoble, St. Martin d'Hères, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37711964900","id":37711964900,"full_name":"Karim Hossen","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Univ. de Grenoble, St. Martin d'Hères, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37715609400","id":37715609400,"full_name":"Roland Groz","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Univ. de Grenoble, St. Martin d'Hères, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281783500","id":37281783500,"full_name":"Catherine Oriat","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Univ. de Grenoble, St. Martin d'Hères, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37373204800","id":37373204800,"full_name":"Jean-Luc Richier","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"In the “Internet of Services” (IoS) vision of the Internet, applications are developed as services using the web standards.

They provide efficient reusability mechanism, thereby reducing the development time and cost. Mostly the source code of web services is unavailable to other developers who use these services. The manual effort spent by them in testing these web services is very large in order to increase the interoperability. Thus automated testing needs to be developed for testing these Web Services, which is possible by adding semantics to Web Service Description Language (WSDL). Also the test case reduction technique is very much required for regression testing. This paper generates test cases for Web Services using reduction techniques Pair-Wise Testing (PWT) and Orthogonal Array Testing (OAT) and compares the two techniques. The structure of Web Services is specified using UML diagrams. The pre and post conditions for the service rule are specified using Object Constraint Language (OCL). The framework developed by this paper transforms this into WSDL-S specifications. These specifications are parsed and transformed into structured DOM tree. Test data with different factors, levels and strengths are generated for PWT and OAT techniques. Test data set generated by this framework would satisfy the constraints of the WSDL. The test cases are then developed based on the data generated, documented in XML based test files called Web Service Test Specifications (WSTS) and executed. The number of test cases required by general testing, PWT, OAT are compared and the better testing technique for testing Web Services is determined.","article_number":"5591616","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5591616","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5591616/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5591616/","publication_title":"2010 Second International conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies","conference_location":"Karur, India","conference_dates":"29-31 July 2010","publication_number":5577351,"is_number":5591555,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"29-31 July 2010","start_page":"1","end_page":"7","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Testing","Web services","Semantics","Unified modeling language","Shape","XML","Arrays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["web services","testing","semantics","test case generation","Orthogonal Testing","OAT"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6590-3","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6591-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6592-7","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/ICACTE.2008.82","title":"Regression Testing Web Applications","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-0-7695-3489-3","issn":"2154-7505","partnum":"08PR3489","rank":15,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Dept. of Comput.

Because of the variety of such environmental conditions, the behavior of the Web application (the application under test, AUT) can differ widely. Failure modes such as buttons not being visible, feedback boxes located in the wrong position, user interface (UI) components not behaving properly are very common and may affect only some of the platforms. Even when practitioners adopt services such as Browserstack that provide virtualization of user platforms, identification of such defects is very demanding, and as a consequence it is seldom performed in a continuous integration fashion. Unfortunately, layout requirements of UIs tend to change very frequently, and the result is that changes are often not tested well enough. What is needed is a software test automation solution. We tackled this problem by adopting a model-based approach, centered on models that represent the data manipulated by the UI and its behavior. A compiler reads these models, integrates model annotations providing details about UI implementation and about test oracles, and produces Java source code of a test harness. The test harness hides details about the Document Object Model (DOM), about the particular test driver that is used to drive the AUT, and details about the oracles that can be used to check if the AUT satisfies certain properties, such as those dealing with its layout. The test engineer can write high level code for jUnit/TestNG test cases, which can then be run on all the desired platforms, using Selenium as a driver.","article_number":"7102626","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7102626","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7102626/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7102626/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST)","conference_location":"Graz, Austria","conference_dates":"13-17 April 2015","publication_number":7102553,"is_number":7102573,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"13-17 April 2015","start_page":"1","end_page":"2","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Unified modeling language","Layout","Software","Testing","Automation","Data models","Adaptation models"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7125-1","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/ICEELI.2012.6360680","title":"Design and development of a user interface to customize web testing scenarios","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-2224-9","partnum":"12EX4789","rank":17,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Prince Research Group, National Engineering School of Sousse, Univ. of Sousse, Sousse, Tunisia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38180097000","id":38180097000,"full_name":"Dalila Souilem Boumiza","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"ENISo, Univ. of Sousse, Sousse, Tunisia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38519435000","id":38519435000,"full_name":"Amani Ben Azzouz","author_order":2}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"A fact that we cannot deny is, web applications testing has become a very large scale, hence the interest of developers and especially testers to find the best solutions ever in order to improve web applications testing quality.

But this approach has failed functionally speaking despite its widespread in most of web testing tools. In fact, the challenge of most developers is to ensure quality by increasing the test accuracy and at the same time speeding up testing process. Facing those urgent needs, and these actual facts (record and replay approach) it became necessary to find another approach, from this came the idea to create model-based tests. Model-based testing is a new approach in web testing world and unlike record and replay technique, just a few tools relay on. Due to all its functional advantages, we have chosen to create a web testing tool that is based on this powerful technique and improve it, in a way that simplify modeling implementation in order to reduce the rate of errors.

Such services might handle sensitive data about several thousands or millions of users. Hence, exploiting services or other undesired effects that cause harm on users has to be avoided. Therefore, for software developers of such applications one of the major tasks in providing security is to embed testing methodologies into the software development cycle, thus minimizing the subsequent damage resulting in debugging and time intensive upgrading. Model-based testing evolved as one of the methodologies which offer several theoretical and practical approaches in testing the system under test (SUT) that combine several input generation strategies like mutation testing, using of concrete and symbolic execution etc. by putting the emphasis on specification of the model of an application. In this work we propose an approach that makes use of an attack pattern model in form of a UML state machine for test case generation and execution.

Due to the scalability provided by clouds, a single web application may be concurrently visited by several millions or billions of users. Thus, the testing and performance evaluations of these applications are increasingly important. User model based evaluations can significantly reduce the manual work required, and can enable us to determine the performance of applications under real runtime environments. Hence, it has become one of the most popular evaluation methods in both industry and academia. Significant efforts have focused on building different kinds of models using mining web access logs, such as Markov models and Customer Behavior Model Graph (CBMG). This paper proposes a new kind of model, named the User Representation Model Graph (URMG), which is built based on CBMG. It uses an algorithm to refine CBMG and optimizes the evaluations execution process. Based on this model, an automatic testing and evaluation system for web applications is designed, implemented, and deployed in our test cloud, which is able to execute all of the analysis and testing operations using only web access logs. In our system, the error rate caused by random access to applications in the execution phase is also reduced, and the results show that the error rate of the evaluation that depends on URMG is 50% less than that which depends on CBMG.","article_number":"6733209","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6733209","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6733209/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6733209/","publication_title":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","publication_number":5971803,"is_number":6733199,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"Feb. 2014","start_page":"65","end_page":"75","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Topology","Testing","Performance evaluation","User interfaces","Data models","Delays","Clustering algorithms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["cloud","web application","performance evaluation","customer behavior","user representation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/CISIM.2010.5643499","title":"Web services regression test case prioritization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-7816-3","partnum":"10EX4583","rank":23,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Cochin University of Science and Technology, India","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586795500","id":37586795500,"full_name":"B Athira","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Information Technology, School of Engineering, Cochin University of Science and Technology, India","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37535370200","id":37535370200,"full_name":"Philip Samuel","author_order":2}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Web services and their underlying system grow over time and need to be retested whenever there is a change. This is essential for ensuring uncompromised quality. If we have modified only a small part of the system, it should be possible to reuse the existing test suite. Anyhow, for large modifications or for large systems, retesting the entire test suite will consume large amounts of time and computing resources. In this paper we propose a new method to prioritize test cases in web applications. Our test prioritization technique orders test cases in such a way that the most beneficial is executed first. Most of the existing test prioritization methods are based on the code of the system, but we propose a model-based test prioritization using activity diagram. Our technique identifies difference between original model and modified model. Using this information we plot activity paths for each test case and identify the most promising paths. The test case which covers these paths is considered as the most beneficial test cases. Our approach is effective in revealing the most promising regression test cases. We have applied our method on an online air ticket reservation system in which we could identify the most beneficial test cases from the existing ones.","article_number":"5643499","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5643499","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5643499/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5643499/","publication_title":"2010 International Conference on Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management Applications (CISIM)","conference_location":"Krakow, Poland","conference_dates":"8-10 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5637902,"is_number":5643452,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"8-10 Oct. 2010","start_page":"438","end_page":"443","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Unified modeling language","Biological system modeling","Business","Testing","Software","Computers","Information systems"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Web services","Test Prioritization","Activity Diagram","Activity paths"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7816-3","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7817-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7818-7","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/I4CT.2015.7219604","title":"Syntax-based test case generation for web application","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-7951-6","rank":24,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University, Songkhla, Thailand","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085714486","id":37085714486,"full_name":"Jakkrit Polpong","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University, Songkhla, Thailand","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586460200","id":37586460200,"full_name":"Supaporn Kansomkeat","author_order":2}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Currently, web applications are popular and widely in many fields such as business, education, medicine and science.
